# Jacdac for STM32F0xx and STM32G0xx

This repository contains firmware for [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) modules based on STM32F0xx and STM32G0xx
chips and is part of the [Jacdac Device Development Kit](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/).

## Bootloader

This repository contains both the firmware for running services (eg., accelerometer service) on a Jacdac module,
and a bootloader which allows for updating the firmware using the Jacdac protocol.
This update process can be performed by the user from the [Jacdac website](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/tools/updater)
(while developing firmware you will typically use a debugger to deploy both the bootloader and the firmware).

## Development

The top-level repo to build is [jacdac-module-template](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-module-template).
It imports as submodules [this repo (jacdac-stm32x0)](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-stm32x0) 
and [jacdac-c](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c)
(which contains platform-independent code implementing Jacdac services, as well as various I2C drivers).

When building your own firmware, you will need to create your own repository from `jacdac-module-template` template.
You can do it by following this link https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-module-template/generate
or using the green "Use this template" button in top-right corner at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-module-template
If you're just playing around, you can simply clone `jacdac-module-template`.

All the instructions below use your copy of `jacdac-module-template` as the root folder.
**You typically will NOT need to fork `jacdac-stm32x0` nor `jacdac-c`.**

The build instructions are here, and not in `jacdac-module-template`, to avoid them getting stale in its various copies.


## Setup

You will need a Unix-like environment to build the firmware (see below for instructions on how to get that on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and the following tools:

* **arm-none-eabi-gcc** (we've been using `9-2019-q4-major` and recently switched to `10-2020-q4-major`)
* **node.js**
* **GNU Make**

### macOS

* **install arm-gcc**: There are verification errors with brew packages for arm-gcc, so we recommend
[downloading the -mac.pkg version from Arm](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads/product-release).

* **setup path**: Once you install it, you either need to add `/Applications/ARM/bin` to your `PATH`, or symlink binaries like this:

```
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -sf /Applications/ARM/bin/arm-none-eabi-* .
```

* **install Node.js** Node.js can be [downloaded from the usual place](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

GNU Make comes with macOS.

### Linux

* please note that `gcc-arm-none-eabi` that comes with Ubuntu won't work; we recommend you download it from Arm
* some linux distros have old versions of Node; get at least 14.5.2 from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md)
* GNU Make is almost always pre-installed

### Windows

You will need a Unix-like environment to build the firmware.
Luckily, you most likely already have one - it comes with Git for Windows.
If you do not have [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) yet, install it.
Then you will need to install GNU Make:

* download GNU Make (without guile) from [EzWinPorts](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/)
* open Administrator command prompt
* run `cd "\Program Files\Git\usr"`
* run `bin\unzip.exe c:\Users\<you>\Downloads\make-4.3-without-guile-w32-bin.zip` replacing `<you>` with your user name

* Head to Start -> Git Bash. When you type `make` you should now see
`make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.`.

* install [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
version `10-2020-q4-major` or `9-2019-q4-major` (do not use other versions for now).

* Get the `.exe` installer, and agree to adding the tools to your `PATH` variable. If the installer fails to add to `PATH`, then do so yourself, adding:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools Arm Embedded\10 2020-q4-major\bin`

* You will also need to [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - take the Windows `.msi` 64 bit installer.
  Node may ask you to install build tools for native npm packages - you don't need that to build this repo.

If you run Git Bash again (it has to be restarted to see change in `PATH`), and type 
`arm-none-eabi-gcc --version` you should see something about `10-2020-q4-major`,
and if you type `node --version` you should get its version number.

If using Black Magic Probe, connect it to your computer.
You should see two COM ports that correspond to it in Device Manager (for example `COM7` and `COM8`).
First try the lower numbered one, and if it doesn't work try the other one.
In `Makefile.user` set `BMP_PORT = //./COM7` - make sure to add `//./`.

Now, follow the usual build instructions below.

Note: using WSL2 instead of the bash shell etc coming with Git 
is not recommended since it cannot access USB for deployment and debugging.

## Building firmware

Run `make`; you should get a successful build.

Upon first run of `make`, a `Makefile.user` file will be created.
You need to adjust the settings in there - there are comments in there that should guide you through the process.

## Deploying firmware

To deploy the firmware to a module you will need a debugger interface.
We've had best success with [Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki) -
it can connect to the MCU even while it's sleeping (provided it wakes up every now and then).

Other debuggers generally require a reset before connection in that case.
There is some support for CMSIS-DAP and ST-LINK/V2 through `openocd`, but we do not recommend using
it due to the sleep issue.

You can convert a [$3 Bluepill board into Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/mmoskal/blackmagic-bluepill).

Following commands can be used to deploy firmware:
* `make run BL=1` - deploy bootloader
* `make run` - deploy firmware
* `make full-flash` - deploy both bootloader and firmware
* `make flash-loop` - run flashing process in a loop - you can flash multiple devices in a row this way

Aliases:
* `make r` for `make run`
* `make l` for `make flash-loop`
* `make ff` for `make full-flash`

When deploying for the first time on a given board, run `make ff`. Later run `make r`.

Other than the building/deployment targets, the following might be of note:

* `make st` - print RAM/flash stats for the current firmware
* `make stf` - same, but break it up by function, not only file
* `make gdb` - run GDB debugger
* `make clean` - clean (duh!)
* `make drop` - build all firmware images specified in `DROP_TARGETS`

### Manual deployment using J-Link/ST-LINK etc.

If you do not want to use Black Magic Probe, you can use `combined-*.hex` and flash with other tools. We have successfully used a [Segger J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link) with [J-Flash](https://www.segger.com/downloads/flasher/) software; make sure the code is flashed to address 0x8000000. We have also used an original [ST-LINK/V2](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) with the [ST-LINK utility](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link004.html). When using these tools you will have to ensure that the target MCU is powered, and that **pin 1 on the JTAG/SWD interface is connected to the target programming voltage**, otherwise the software may report that it cannot detect the target at all. 

When run you build, it will print out something like this:

```
COMBINE built/touch-sensor-1.0/combined-touch.hex
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  14468	      0	   1824	  16292	   3fa4	built/touch-sensor-1.0/app-touch.elf
   3296	      0	   2616	   5912	   1718	built/touch-sensor-1.0/bl-touch.elf
```

There are two ELF files - one for the application and one for bootloader.
Before listing sizes, the Makefile gives path of an Intel HEX file combining both
which can be flashed with any software, in this case `built/touch-sensor-1.0/combined-touch.hex`.

## Adding new modules

* [create a new repo](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-module-template/generate) from `jacdac-module-template`;
  let's say the new repo is called `jacdac-acme-corp-modules`
* update `jacdac-stm32` and `jacdac-c` submodules (eg., with `make update-submodules`)
* copy `targets/_example/` to `targets/buzzer-v1.0/` (replacing `buzzer-v1.0` with the name of the module or series of modules)
* edit [targets/buzzer-v1.0/board.h](targets/_example/board.h) to match your module
* you likely do not need to edit [targets/buzzer-v1.0/config.mk](targets/_example/config.mk),
  unless using F0 chip
* edit [targets/buzzer-v1.0/profile/module.c](targets/_example/profile/module.c) 
  to include your module name and used services (follow comments in `module.c`);
  see [jd_services.h](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c/blob/master/services/jd_services.h)
  for list of services
* rename `module.c` to match the type of module (eg. `buzzer.c`)
* if you have several modules with non-conflicting `board.h` definitions,
  you can create more files under `targets/buzzer-v1.0/profile/`;
  otherwise you'll need to create `targets/thermocouple-v1.0` or something similar
* edit `Makefile.user` to set `TRG`, eg. `TRG = targets/buzzer-v1.0/profile/buzzer.c`
* run `make`; this will generate a new unique identifier and place as an argument of `FIRMWARE_IDENTIFIER` macro
* make sure to never change the firmware identifier number, as that will break future firmware updates

If you copy `targets/jm-*/profiles/something.c` from
[jacdac-msr-modules](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-msr-modules) to start your own module, remember to rename it, and
set the `FIRMWARE_IDENTIFIER` to `0` (the one in `targets/_examples` already has it set to `0`).
This way, the build process will generate a new firmware identifier.

Now, edit `DROP_TARGETS` in `Makefile` to only include your `buzzer-v1.0` folder
(and in future `thermocouple-v1.0` etc.).
Make sure to remove the string `acme-corp-button` from `DROP_TARGETS`.

When you run `make drop` now, you should get a `.uf2` file combining firmware for all your modules.

## Adding new services and drivers

This topic is [covered in jacdac-c](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-c#adding-new-services).
When adding services or drivers, you can put them in `addons/` folder of your modules repo,
or submit them as PRs in `jacdac-c`.

## Release process

Use `make bump` to create a new release.
This will ask you for a version number (providing a default that just updates the patch number),
update `CHANGES.md`, create a git tag, and push it to the origin.

If the `jacdac-acme-corp-modules` repo is public on github, the github action will create a new binary
file and place it under `dist/fw-VERSION.uf2`, so there's nothing else to do.

If you want to build by hand, run `make drop` after `make bump` and copy `built/fw-VERSION.uf2`
to `dist/fw-VERSION.uf2` in your release repo.
You should probably also copy over `CHANGES.md`, so your users have some idea of what it being updated.
